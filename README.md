# Dart Language Learning Examples

This repository contains simple command-line Dart applications designed for learning the basics of the Dart language syntax and common implementations.  The files in this repository are intended as self-contained examples, each focusing on a specific Dart language feature.

## Purpose

These examples are primarily for educational purposes.  They demonstrate how to implement various concepts in Dart, such as:

*   Working with lists and their methods
*   Defining and using classes
*   Implementing interfaces
*   And other fundamental Dart features

## Usage

Each file in this repository is a standalone Dart program that can be run from the command line.  To run an example:

1.  Ensure you have the Dart SDK installed.
2.  Navigate to the directory containing the example file in your terminal.
3.  Run the command `dart run <filename.dart>`, replacing `<filename.dart>` with the name of the file you want to execute (e.g., `dart run list_example.dart`).

## Contents

Each file is named descriptively to indicate the Dart feature it demonstrates.  For example:

*   `list.dart`: Demonstrates how to create and manipulate lists.
*   `classes.dart`: Shows how to define and use classes.
*   `interfaces.dart`: Illustrates how to implement interfaces.

## Contributing

This repository is primarily for personal learning.  Contributions are not expected at this time. However, suggestions and feedback are welcome!

## Reources

The Fireship Dart course was a particularly valuable resource in the creation of these examples, providing a solid foundation for understanding Dart syntax and best practices: [https://fireship.io/courses/dart/](https://fireship.io/courses/dart/)

For further learning about the Dart language, the official Dart documentation is an excellent resource: [https://dart.dev/](https://dart.dev/)
